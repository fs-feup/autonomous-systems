# FS FEUP Autonomous Systems Documentation

This folder contains most of the documentation of the project.

## Environment Setup

Follow the environment setup guide for this repository [here](environment_setup.md).

## Overleafs

Eventhough the documentation present in this repository in the form of markdown files and automatically generated code documentation covers the knowledge behind the technologies used and the taxonomy of our code, it does not mention the decision making behind the chosen algorithms and the structure of the system, nor does it inform on the theoretical topics behind the algorithms implemented. For that purpose, multiple latex documents have been written, the links to which can be found in [the link sheet in the root of the Google drive folder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OvYjp04SEVLIeTrFB5lN5wh7S1SFSVgTsl96FE75TGk/edit?usp=sharing) (or you can find them in their [github repo](https://github.com/fs-feup/documentation)). **This documentation will start being written in Notion.**
