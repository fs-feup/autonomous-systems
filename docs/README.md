# FS FEUP Autonomous Systems Documentation

This folder contains most of the documentation of the project.

## Tutorials

There are many tutorials in this project in the [tutorials directory](./tutorials). There is also a [Startup Guide](./tutorials/startup_guide.md) suggesting some tutorials and the order in which they should be read/tried.

## Overleafs

Eventhough the documentation present in this repository in the form of markdown files and automatically generated code documentation covers the knowledge behind the technologies used and the taxonomy of our code, it does not mention the decision making behind the chosen algorithms and the structure of the system, nor does it inform on the theoretical topics behind the algorithms implemented. For that purpose, multiple latex documents have been written, the links to which can be found in [the link sheet in the root of the Google drive folder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OvYjp04SEVLIeTrFB5lN5wh7S1SFSVgTsl96FE75TGk/edit?usp=sharing).
