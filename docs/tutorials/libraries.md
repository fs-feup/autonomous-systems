## RCL - ROS Client Library

The RCL stands for ROS Client Library and is the main interaction form with the ROS2 environment. RCL has two different implementations for each language supported by ROS: python (rclpy) and c++ (rclcpp). 
The RCL interface is implemented in more than those languages. However, the rest of the libraries are community maintained. 
Essentially this library allows for programming of custom nodes and communication mechanisms between them.
