# Startup Guide 

In order to properly contribute to this project, a development environment is necessary:

- a simulator
- ros2
- possibly a virtual machine
- a code editor/IDE

It is also necessary to learn how to use certain tools and programming languages.

This guide is meant to help the developer setup the environment required to work for this project and get an insight on the technologies used.

**NOTE:** This guide and all the tutorials are supposed to be incremental. As the knowledge expands, new tutorials should be created and existing ones improved.
