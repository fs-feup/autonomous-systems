# Git Tutorial

Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.

## Instalation of git

First and foremost, before using Git, you must have it installed. You can follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) to complete the installation process.



## Step by step using git

1. **Create a new Directory**

```shell
mkdir git_tutorial
cd git_tutorial 
```

2. **Start a git project**

```shell
git init # Initializes the git repository
```

Now the git repository is created. It is time to test it.

3. **The tracking of the files**

To track the files in the repository, use the command:

```shell
git status
```

Since you do not have any tracked files, the output isn't particularly interesting. Let's create our first file.

```shell
touch fs.txt
```

Running `git status` again will yield a more interesting output, showing that the file `fs.txt` was created.

4. **The staging area**

The staging area consists of tracked files that have been added. It contains the files that will be committed later. To add a file to the staging area, use the following command. Let's use it with `fs.txt`.

```shell
git add fs.txt
```

Alternatively, if you want to add all files to the staging area, use the command

```shell
git add -A
```

5. **Our first commit**

Now that the tracked files are in the staging area, let's make our first commit. In Git, a commit refers to a snapshot of the changes made to files in a repository at a specific point in time. Each commit is accompanied by a unique identifier and a commit message that describes the changes made. To commit our changes, use:

```shell
git commit -m <commit message>
```

In our case, we will commit like this:

```shell
git commit -m "Added the fs.txt file"
```


<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/git_tutorial/git1.png" style="width: 25%; height: auto;">
</p>

Your commits should look like this. We have our commit represented as a bubble. The `master` is the default branch that we are using to develop (more details about branches will be explained later). The `HEAD` is only pointing to the branch that we are developing.



6. **Tracking the commits**

If you want to check the last commits that were made, you can use:

```shell
git log
```

7. **Another commit**

Now, let's modify the `fs.txt` file and follow the same process as before.

```shell
echo "Autonomous Systems" > fs.txt
git add -A
git commit -m "Wrote fs.txt"
git log
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/git_tutorial/git2.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
</p>

Now you have two commits that track changes to the `fs.txt` file.

8. **Creation of Branches**

A Git branch is a parallel version of a repository that allows you to work on different aspects of a project simultaneously, enabling you to make changes without affecting the main codebase until you're ready to merge your work.

We can create a branch this way:

```shell
git branch <branch-name>
```

In our case, we will create a branch named `documentation`:

```shell
git branch documentation
```

To switch to the new branch, use the following command:

```shell
git checkout documentation
```

If you want to list all the branches, use the command:

```shell
git branch
```

9. **Commit to the branch**

Now, follow the procedures from step 7:

```shell
echo "Perception" > fs2.txt
git add fs2.txt
git commit -m "Wrote fs2.txt"
```
<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/git_tutorial/git3.png" style="width: 70%; height: auto;">
</p>

In the figure, we can see now that we not only have the `master` branch that points to a commit, but also we have a `documentation` branch that points to our very last commit.

Then, go back to the master branch and make a small commit like this:

```shell
git checkout master
echo "Planning" > fs3.txt
git add fs3.txt
git commit -m "Wrote fs3.txt"
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/git_tutorial/git4.png" style="width: 70%; height: auto;">
</p>

If you check the commits with `git log`, you will notice that the commit `Wrote fs2.txt` you created isn't there. This is because the commit is on the other branch.

You may test commiting on your branch to garantee that you're conforable with that.

10. **Merging Branches**

Now that you have made all the changes to your file and you're certain it is functional, you can perform an action called `merge`. This action will merge the two branches.

```shell
git checkout master
git merge documentation
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/git_tutorial/git5.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>

With this, the master branch will be updated with the content that was added in the documentation branch.

Note that this command differs from:

```shell
git checkout documentation
git merge master
```

In this case, the documentation branch is the one that is updated. The master branch remains the same.

11. **Integration with a remote repository**

Now, we will integrate our local repository with a remote repository, such as GitHub. With GitHub, several people can interact with the same repository. You can follow a step-by-step tutorial on how to integrate your machine with GitHub [here](https://youtu.be/iWs34DO_H2M?feature=shared).


12. **Push the repository to Github**

Next, we need to configure our local repository with the remote one. First, use:

```shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your username>/<repository name>.git
```

Then, use the `push` command to update the GitHub repository with our local changes.

```shell
git push
```

## Our Repository Context

If you are already comfortable with Git, the next step is to follow [this tutorial](../compile-test-run.md), which provides tips on cloning the project, installing its dependencies, compiling the code, and running and testing the code. However, here are some additional pieces of advice:

1. **Commit Rules**

There are git norms that must be respected. They can be found [here](../project-rules.md#commits).

2. **Pull Requests**

Directly committing to the main (dev) branch should be avoided. Instead, you should create a branch for your development and create a pull request for review when you believe that your work is complete and can be added to the dev branch.

Every pull request must have a reviewer who must approve the pull request. Additionally, the pull request must have the approval of the department leader. When both reviewers approve the pull request, it can be merged.
