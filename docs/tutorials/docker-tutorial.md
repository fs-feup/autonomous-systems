## Docker Dev Containers and VSCode

Visual Studio Code contains an extension that allows for the creation of docker containers specifically tailored to be used as a development environment: it is essentially a tool that enables the creation of docker containers inside which vscode can run and with a agilized creation process. It provides many default options and easy tool integration. You can watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1RavPr_878) for more information on the matter.
