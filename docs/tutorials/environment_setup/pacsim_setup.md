# PacSim Setup

PacSim is a similator first created by Elbflorace, which has released it as an open-source project. It is a light-weight simulator that follows the style of the FSSim simulator. We have forked the original repository and will be using our fork for personalization. Relevant development done might be later included in the original repository.

## Set Up

PacSim is truly a very light simulator. As such, all you have to do to have it working is have the repository cloned and the basic tools required for our system (vscode, docker). Then, just use the docker dev container environment set up or the docker-compose.yml script. Any other information, repher to [its repository](https://github.com/fs-feup/pacsim).
