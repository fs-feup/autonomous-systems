# Contents

This folder contains tracks generated with the EUFS Simulator track generator tool. Each folder contains the image of a track (contains the visual representation of the track, which might be useful to understand why some programs don't work as well in certain tracks, but also information about how the track was generated), the track in CSV format (as it was generated by the simulator), and the track in a TXT file which is read by the planning node. 

To convert between track formats, the python script "track_convert_to_txt.py", which was fully generated by ChatGPT, was used. That script converts the tracks automatically, but it must be run in this directory.

The images are simply print screens of the track generator tool, which displays the tracks. Note that the x-axis in the images is positive to the left and the y-axis is positive downwards.
