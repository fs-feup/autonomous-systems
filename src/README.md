# Contributing

You work with your **shell always in this directory**. In it, you can find mutiple scripts that will help you contributing to the project. You need to install the tools in [this file](../technologies.md) to contribute.

## Natural Workflow 

- CD to src
  ```sh
  cd src
  ```
- Program
- Compile
  ```sh
  colcon build --packages-select [your package and others necessary]
  source install/setup.bash
  ```
- Run code
  ```sh
  ros2 run [package_name] [node_name]
  ```
- Run tests
  ```sh
  colcon test --packages-select [your package and others necessary] [--event-handler=console_direct+] #last part for verbose
  ```
FOR C++:
- Remove compilation result folders
  ```sh
  rm -rf build install log
  ```
- Run static analysis
  ```sh
  ./cppcheck.sh
  ```
- Format code
  ```sh
  ./clang-format.sh
  ```
- Run linter
  ```sh 
  ./cpplint.sh
  ```
For Python:
- Run liner/formatter
  ```sh
  ./ruff.sh 
  ```
For everybody:
- Run documentator
  ```sh
  ./document.sh
  ```
- Update changelog if a feature was implemented
- Finally push changes to repository
  ```sh
  git add -A
  git commit -m "feat(<package>): <description>"
  git push
  ```
For the specific ways of running each of the modules, refer to the README.md in their folder.
